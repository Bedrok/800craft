## About 800craft
800craft is a modified version of the popular Minecraft server software called fCraft. It was created by Jonty800 and is now maintained by GlennMR and Jonty800.

800Craft is currently working on a big update with will include Physics and many more features.
Something to get real excited for is the MineManager that is coming very soon. You'll be able to access your console and monitor month by month server statistics anywhere in the world from 800Craft.net and best of all - it's going to be 100% free!
Download it now, it's extremely stable and very high on performance and when we release our next version, we'll send you an automatic update :).

## HeartbeatSaver

There are 2 ways you can use this:

* When you shutdown your server, or the server crashes, the Heartbeat Saver automatically opens, keeping your uptime on minecraft.net the same as it was before shutdown.
Nobody likes suddenly dropping to the bottom of a list containing 1000+ servers.
