## HeartbeatSaver

There are 2 ways you can use this:

* Run the Heartbeat Saver while your server is up to give additional support to your server's uptime not resetting
* When you shutdown your server, the Heartbeat Saver automatically opens, keeping your uptime the same as it was before shutdown.

This is a unique Server Software feature that is only found in 800Craft.
